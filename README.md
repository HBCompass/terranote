#TerraNote#
=========

TerraNote meets the need for real-time information during natural disasters and extreme weather events. When a disaster strikes there is a lag between when it happens and when news sources can update their audiences with information. TerraNote connects users to a human readable summary of information directly from monitoring agencies. The app generates a summary for each event, maps the eventâ€™s location and allows users to share the information with their preferred social network.

##Technology Stack##

TerraNote is a flask app connected to a sqlite database and uses SQLAlchemy as the ORM. Pages are controlled by Jinja2 templates with a Bootstrap framework. The current version uses the [geoJSON](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) api from the United States Geological Survery and the Google Maps Javascript API v3. 

###File Guide###

- model.py : Creates the database
- quake.py : Gets the feed from the USGS
- note.py : Controls the flask app

*There are additional files in the repo for features in progress, but this list covers the ones you need to recreate the project as depicted in the screenshots.*

###Installation###

- Clone the repo
- Set up a virtual environment
- Pip install -r requirements.txt
- At the command line: 

```xml
python -i model.py
```
Then:

```xml
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///terranote.db", echo=True)
```
Then: 

```xml
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```
- In a new shell use ls command in project folder and verify *terranote.db* exists
- To see the structure of the database go to the command line:
```xml
sqlite3 terranote.db
sqlite> .tables
sqlite> .schema
```
- To add quakes to the database, quit SQLlite and run quake.py
```xml
python quake.py
```
- Run the app by starting the flask server:
```xml
python note.py
```

###Notes###

Currently, the earthquake maps and pages are fed by a live data stream from the USGS.The next steps will include creating the same data pipeline for the other event types which are currently mocked up with static data.

Expansion features will include user logins, location saving, event alerts and calculating the distance between the user and events.
