TerraNote
=========

TerraNote meets the need for real-time information during natural disasters and extreme weather events. When an earthquake strikes there is a lag between when it happens and when news sources can update their audiences with information. TerraNote connects users to a human readable summary of information directly from monitoring agencies. Users can sort events by time or location. The app generates a summary for each event, maps the eventâ€™s location and allows users to share the information with their preferred social network.
